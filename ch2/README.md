Added:
- DesignController (to select ingredients for taco, and name it)
- OrderController (place order by input address, credit card number, etc)
- Related html templates
- Session
- Validation
- Simple WebConfig

Key Takeaway:
- No need to use @Data as in Spring-Java
- @Slf4j and lombok seem not working for kotlin. Using workaround

Btw, if adding dependencies not working (no auto-completion in IDEA), just restart IDEA and it should work.
